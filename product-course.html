              <p>Each year, around 95% of our Access to HE students progress to university on completion of their programme, going on to over 100 different universities across many different degrees and disciplines.</p>
              <p><b>FEES:</b> We are waiting for the government to announce the fees for Access courses this year. We expect them to be confirmed in April and will let applicants know as soon as they are released. As a guide, fees in the past have ranged between £3022 to £4000. </p>
              <p>Funding rates for Advanced Learner Loans, which can be used to pay for Access to Higher Education courses, are released in June.</p>
              <p><b>Remember:</b> if you go to university and complete a degree, the government will write off the loan for your Access course. Please see the ‘Additional Information’ tab for more details.</p>
